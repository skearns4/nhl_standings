# nhl_standings
This is a Scrapy crawler that finds the latest Standings in the NHL Metropolitan Division and writes them to a text file.

I use this text file with Geektool to display the standings on my destkop. (http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/)

In hindsight, using an HTML parser or a less powerful webscraper would have probably been more appropriate than Scrapy.
